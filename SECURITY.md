# Security Policy

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue.

Instead, report it privately:

- Preferred: open a GitHub Security Advisory (once the repo is on GitHub)
- Alternative: contact the maintainers through a private channel agreed by the project

We will acknowledge receipt and work on a fix.
